Q1
What is an input to this program that will result in a correct validation?

Taking a look at our file here, it is a pyc file. A quick google search and I found an online decompiler that will decompile pyc binaries for us. Great!

Lets take a look at our program
`vals = list('tfzbwlyzljylawhzzdvyk')`

Right of the bat we see this suspicious string. Generally, if we see encrypted data, we can find something that is helpful to us. Based on one of the next lines 
`x = ord(password[counter]) + 7` 
It looks like we are dealing with a Caesar Cipher of some sort, shift up 7 times. Looking at cyber chef;

we get our (very weak and obvious) password
