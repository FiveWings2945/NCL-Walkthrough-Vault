History
Description
***
Analyze a Firefox sqlite history database and answer questions about what happened. It you are not familiar with SQL you may want to learn more about SQL here:Â [https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/sql-tutorial/](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/sql-tutorial/)

Questions
***
For this challenge, you can use either a command-line interface to access the SQL tables, or you can use a database viewer. I personally am still working on learning SQL so I used this [database viewer](https://sqlitebrowser.org/). You can download it on Windows, Mac, and most Linux distros. I personally use Kali for NCL, so in my case, the command was
`sudo apt install sqlitebrowser`

We can then open our database file in this browser. (Note: This challenge will involve no scripting. Just point and click until we grab our answer)

Here's what our view looks like

What we will want to do is inspect individual entries of the available tables, so we can go and enter the `browse data` tab near the top. Then the table that will most likely be the most interest to us will be the `moz_places` table.
