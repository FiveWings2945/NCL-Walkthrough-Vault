WIFI PCAP 1
Description
***
We have created a packet capture from our test lab to see if you can handle the challenges of wireless password cracking.

Questions
***
These challenges will require a software called aircrack-ng. You can install this using.
`sudo apt install aircrack-ng`

We will also be using Wireshark, which comes default on Kali Linux

First, we will run a simple aircrack-ng analysis on our packet capture to get some helpful information to help with the first few questions.

`aircrack-ng PCAP1.pcap`

Q1
How many IVs are in the packet capture?

Found on the top right of the info dump

Q2
What is the key size of the wireless network data encryption method in bits?

Here we can see the amount of bytes in the found Wired Equivalent Policy (WEP) key (denoted by "KEY FOUND") and look up the encryption method based on that number (will have to convert bytes into bits first). In our case, our key is 40 bits, and according to Google, the WEP will use a 40 bit WEP key along side a 24 bit IV to create the key. That will be our answer.

Q3
What is the IV for the first packet in the capture in hexadecimal representation?

We can open our packet capture in Wireshark and view the packet WEP parameters. There we can find the initialization vector (IV) for our first packet

Q4
What is the WEP key?

This is found, as denoted by the "KEY FOUND" in the aircrack output

Q5
What is the TCP checksum, in hexadecimal representation, of the first packet in the capture?

This is where we move to Wireshark. Open up the packet capture in Wireshark. You will see a bunch of encrypted traffic that you cant access. To decrypt the web traffic, we need to decrypt it using the WEP key we found. When the pcap is loaded, in Wireshark, go to 
`Edit → Preferences → Protocols → IEEE 802.11 → Decryption Keys (Edit)`
Here you will create a new key by hitting the plus in the bottom left hand corner. The key type will be WEP, and the key value will be the WEP value you found earlier. Then hit okay, and then Apply in the previous screen to apply the decryption key to the capture. You can now see the decrypted traffic.

You can then expand the TCP field in the first packet and scroll until you find the TCP checksum
