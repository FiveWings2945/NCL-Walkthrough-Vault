Fencing
Description
***
Our analysts have obtained encrypted messages. We saw hand-written notes that indicated the keys as being "3" and "5". See if you can crack them.

Questions
***
The description notes that a key was used to encrypt the text, hinting at public key cryptography. Looking at the title, we can extract a small piece of information. We search for fence in cyber chef and we find an encryption method called Rail Fence Cipher Encode. This seems to be a good option as it requires a key of some sort.

| Helen   | Cair eruSA-0org sgaeudrpesr K-II98.ue cn seYQ3 | Rail Fence Cipher | The clue notes there is a key that was used to encrypt the message. This is a form of public key cryptography. We can extrapolate the type of crypto from the title of the puzzle and using the key provided. |
