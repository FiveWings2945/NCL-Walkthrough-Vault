This Vault is meant to be a guide for completing the gymnasium challenges for NCL. Each section will contain the writeups for each of the rooms with the process I used to complete them, alongside the tools I used to complete each room and how I used them/ how I could tell how to use them.

General Tips:
- Use these walkthroughs to supplement your learning - not replace it
- These walkthroughs help create a structure to attack future problems. There's almost no guarantee that any of these will show up in an actual competition.
- There's almost never one singular way to attack a problem, so don't feel chained to my thought process. Feel free to use your own methods you develop.
- *All flags are located under the **flags** note. This will help those who want to follow the process but avoid just having the answers there*
